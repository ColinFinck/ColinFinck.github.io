      <description>WaxDragon took a look at what happened in ReactOS during September The stats:
In Sepember, there were:
578 commits
98 bugs opened
94 bugs closed
I wasn&#39;t able to determine the bugs that weere touched during the last month, since something made *all* bugs appear touched.
A little change of format, I will review the closed bugs first, then go over the SVN commits in less detail than last month.</description>
