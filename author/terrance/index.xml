      <description>New mailing list search! The ability to search the mailing lists with Google wasn&#39;t enough for me so I&#39;ve created a new more flexible mailing list search. This is available under http://www.reactos.org/mlsearch/
We also decided to change the voting system. Now votes are done on the forum instead of the mailing list. This way we can do anonymous votes and keep track of the many decisions that must be made.</description>
