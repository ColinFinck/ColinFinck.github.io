<p>See <a href="https://www.reactos.org/node/886">here</a> for explanation of the Bunnies.</p>
<p>When Z logged onto the ROS virtual net he was met with two unexpected things.&nbsp; Seeing as one involved an AI hivemind that the team still did not fully understand he decided to satisfy his curiosity with the other surprise.</p>
<p>“Colin.”</p>
<p>The German man glanced up.&nbsp; “Oh, hey Z.&nbsp; Wasn’t expecting you in today.”</p>
<p>“Likewise,” Z said with a slight smirk.&nbsp; “Don’t you Europeans check out for the entire week before Christmas?&nbsp; Or is that just the French?”</p>
<p>Colin chuckled.&nbsp; “Don’t let Pierre hear that, he’s had to pull some extra hours fixing that stupid routing issue that keeps cropping up.”</p>
<p>Z frowned, the glasses on his virtual avatar shifting slightly.&nbsp; “Remind me again why we’re still using that piece of crap?”</p>
<p>“Because all of the people sufficiently competent to put together an alternative are busy on more pressing projects,” Colin replied.</p>
<p>The only response from Z was a grunt as he settled into his own terminal.&nbsp; “So what are you doing here anyway?&nbsp; I thought you’d be spending time with the family or the girlfriend.&nbsp; Or both.”</p>
<p>“We have an end of the year report due to the German government,” Colin said.&nbsp; “And since it needs to be in German, I’m the one stuck drafting it.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” Z said sympathetically.&nbsp; He then glanced over at the pair of Hackbunnies off to the side.&nbsp; “So, what exactly are the Bunnies doing?”</p>
<p>Colin followed Z’s gaze and shrugged.&nbsp; “Beats me.&nbsp; Those two were like that when I came in and the only thing I got out from Alpha was they were ‘calculating particle dynamics of snowfall.’”&nbsp; A shrug.&nbsp; “I have no idea why.”</p>
<p>“Well, that at least has more potential for practical applications than them spending cycles simulating a soccer field.”</p>
<p>When Colin glanced over at his friend Z was somehow maintaining a completely neutral expression.&nbsp; He let out a resigned snort and went back to work.&nbsp; For someone who was not even born an American he certainly took a perverse pleasure in needling fans of the beautiful game.&nbsp; The two went about their business in relative silence after that, Colin polishing the report with the formalism that the German language often allowed and Z intermixing his code review with the odd expletive.&nbsp; Reading other people’s code tended to be a somewhat thankless task.&nbsp; Reading code one wrote years or even just months ago felt much the same way.</p>
<p>A beep sounded, signaling an incoming message.&nbsp; Both men looked up and frowned as they saw the ID of the caller.</p>
<p>“This can’t be good,” Z remarked.</p>
<p>“No, no it can’t,” Colin agreed as he tapped his console to answer.&nbsp; “Hey Pierre, what’s up?”</p>
<p>“The Bunnies are doing it again,” the Frenchman said.&nbsp; “CPU load on the primary cluster’s been pegged at near 100% for the last three hours.”</p>
<p>Colin sighed.&nbsp; The last time the Hackbunnies had eaten up this much processing power was when they created a physically accurate reproduction of a football pitch.&nbsp; In fact the dedication of the Bunnies to accuracy had seen them simulate down to individual blades of grass.&nbsp; After a couple of iterations they had pared back the level of detail, using a more coarse grained system for the field that balanced realism and resource usage.&nbsp; It was still a remarkable system however and the Bunnies continued to refine not only the simulation but also their prowess at the sport.&nbsp; The video streaming channel that Z had set up for broadcasting recordings of the weekly matches was also proving very popular with several thousand subscribers.&nbsp; And of course it was called the Bunny Soccer League.</p>
<p>“Alright, Z and I’ll go take a look,” Colin said.</p>
<p>“Try to get them to back off a little bit,” Pierre said.&nbsp; “If they manage to blow something it’ll be at least two weeks before we can replace it thanks to the holidays.”</p>
<p>“Gotcha.”&nbsp; Colin closed the connection and looked over at Z.&nbsp; “Shall we?”</p>
<p>His friend’s response was a wiry grin before Z hit a button and transferred over to the cluster.&nbsp; Colin chuckled and began navigating his own VR menu to do the same.&nbsp; As the room disappeared he had just long enough to notice that the two Bunnies that had been there before were now gone.</p>
<p>The transfer completed shortly afterward and Colin blinked a few times before shielding his eyes with a hand.</p>
<p>“Oh, wow that’s bright.”</p>
<p>“That it is,” Z agreed, though the lenses of his virtual glasses had already darkened to account for it.</p>
<p>Colin quickly calibrated the gain of his visual receptors so as not to have to squint.&nbsp; He looked about, finding nothing but an unbroken field of white snow.</p>
<p>“What is this?” he wondered aloud.</p>
<p>Z knelt down and ran his hand through the snow.&nbsp; “Top layer is stiffer, underneath is a fine powder, not quite compacted.&nbsp; Kind of like after a major snowfall.”&nbsp; He let the powder sprinkle through his fingers.&nbsp; “Very fine detail, I wonder if they’re simulating this at the flake level.”</p>
<p>“Now that would be excessive,” Colin remarked as his feet crunched through the snow.&nbsp; “But why would they bother?”</p>
<p>“I have no idea.”&nbsp; Z stood back up and looked around.&nbsp; “Don’t see them around either.”</p>
<p>Colin brought up another menu.&nbsp; “I’ll tag their locations.&nbsp; Still, I suppose it’s a good thing they haven’t bothered simulating the actual cold.”</p>
<p>“We could just turn that off,” Z said nonchalantly even as his eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“True but-”</p>
<p>Doof.</p>
<p>Colin blinked a few seconds before his brain caught up and figured out that the hunk of stuff obscuring his sight was a snowball.&nbsp; In the time that took another sailed through the air before smashing into his face, shattering into a shower of fine powder.&nbsp; Z was a bit luckier, having ducked the first snowball aimed at him.&nbsp; The next five or so more than made up for the earlier miss.</p>
<p>Shrill squeaks filled the ear and from the previously unbroken white landscape the long ears of a dozen or so rabbits began poking out.&nbsp; A couple were jumping up and down as well, their bodies half disappearing as they landed back in the snow.&nbsp; Colin wiped his face and gazed at the sight with an air of incredulity.&nbsp; And then a snowball shot out from beside him and landed amongst a cluster of the Bunnies who promptly scattered.&nbsp; Colin looked over to see Z reaching down and gathering up snow for another one.</p>
<p>“Z?”</p>
<p>“Yeah?” the man said as he leaned aside to dodge the return fire.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“They started it,” Z said as he threw another snowball.</p>
<p>Six more answered him, pelting the man and leaving him with a fine coat of the stuff sliding down his form.&nbsp; Z chuckled.</p>
<p>“And they’re damn good shots at that.”</p>
<p>Before Colin could make another comment another thud smacked him in the chest.&nbsp; He looked ahead again to see a Bunny hopping up and down.&nbsp; It then began rolling up another ball and made to throw.&nbsp; Colin quickly stepped aside as it came flying at him.</p>
<p>“Did-did the Bunnies create this snow simulation in order to have a snowball fight!?” Colin said incredulously.</p>
<p>“Seems like it,” Z said in between dodging, not entirely successfully, more incoming fire.&nbsp; He tossed a snowball of his own.&nbsp; “Hah!”</p>
<p>Colin looked over and saw a Bunny shaking off the white fluff off its fur.</p>
<p>Z looked back at his friend.&nbsp; “Well?&nbsp; You’re just going to stand there or are you going to help?”</p>
<p>Colin spent perhaps another few seconds just watching the other man trade fire with the Bunnies, and getting hit again for his inaction, before he let out a short laugh.</p>
<p>“Whatever.&nbsp; It’s almost Christmas anyway.”</p>
<p>And promptly began cupping snowballs of his own.&nbsp; The squeaks from the Bunnies became louder and they welcomed Colin’s joining the game with a flurry of shots.&nbsp; The German man began moving, breaking out into a slight trot even as he returned the favors.&nbsp; The Bunnies were clever though, they could flatten their bodies out to duck into the snow and more or less let any throws fly right overhead.&nbsp; And then another group of Bunnies appeared behind Colin, giving him pause as he thought himself surrounded.&nbsp; Instead of pelting him however they began piling it on against the Bunnies that had been aiming at the German.&nbsp; Colin watched in bemusement for a few seconds before shrugging.</p>
<p>“Enemy of my enemy,” he said with a chuckle and joined in once more.</p>
<hr>
<p>An hour had almost certainly passed by the time Colin collapsed in the virtual snow, mentally worn out despite not having actually physically exerted himself.&nbsp; Z trudged over and gave his friend a grin.</p>
<p>“Enjoyed yourself there?”</p>
<p>Colin nodded with a smile of his own.&nbsp; “Most fun I’ve had in ages.”</p>
<p>He raised an arm towards Z, who took the hand and pulled him back up.</p>
<p>“You know, when the Hackbunnies first awakened I never could shake this, fear, that we might lose control of them, that they might decide to go rogue and we would have to try to shut them down,” Colin said.</p>
<p>Z raised an eyebrow.&nbsp; “You over it now?”</p>
<p>“Not yet, but it’s getting there.”&nbsp; Colin smirked.&nbsp; “Not all of us have your unending optimism Z.”</p>
<p>Z snorted.&nbsp; “Optimism nothing, I knew we could trust the Bunnies the moment I saw them playing soccer.”</p>
<p>“Oh?&nbsp; Why is that?”</p>
<p>“They decided that playing a game like soccer was worth their cycle time.&nbsp; Anything that can find enjoyment in a simple game, we can find common ground with.&nbsp; And common ground is all we need to be partners.”</p>
<p>Colin considered those words.&nbsp; “Huh.&nbsp; An interesting way to look at it.”</p>
<p>“Anyway, we better get back,” Z said.&nbsp; “I’m sure Pierre’ll want a report on what the Bunnies have been up to and you still have that report to finish writing.”</p>
<p>Colin began to nod when out of the corner of his eye he caught something.&nbsp; Looking over he saw a group of Bunnies working together rolling up a large ball of snow.&nbsp; Another group was doing the same albeit the fruit of their labor was not quite as big.&nbsp; A third group topped it all off with the smallest of the three.</p>
<p>“You don’t think?” Colin began.</p>
<p>Z followed the other man’s gaze and chuckled.&nbsp; “Well, I suppose that’s another winter tradition they’ve decided to partake in.”&nbsp; He clapped his friend on the shoulder.&nbsp; “C’mon, let’s give them a hand.”</p>
<p>Colin hesitated for a brief moment.&nbsp; “I should get that report done.”</p>
<p>“Do you actually expect anyone to read it before the New Year?” Z countered.</p>
<p>A chuckle sounded.&nbsp; “I suppose you’re right.”</p>
<p>With that Colin began trudging after his friend.&nbsp; The Bunnies watched the two approach and let out more playful squeaks.&nbsp; Colin grinned.&nbsp; There were certainly worse ways to spend his time than in showing the Bunnies how to properly carry out all the winter traditions.</p>
